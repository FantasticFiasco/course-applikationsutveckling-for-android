    <string name="mainactivity_abouttext">The Robber Language is a Swedish language game. It became popular after the books about Kalle Blomkvist by Astrid Lindgren, where the children use it as a code, both at play and in solving actual crimes. The principle is easy enough. Every consonant (spelling matters, not pronunciation) is doubled, and an o is inserted in-between. Vowels are left intact.</string>
